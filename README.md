# Linux Tools

A growing suite of scripts I find useful

## [01 - rename.sh](./readmes/rename.md)

This is a batch renaming script which will loop through a directory of files and rename them to an incrementing set of numbers.

## [02 - takeover.sh](./readmes/takeover.md)

This script is from https://github.com/marcan/takeover.sh

A script to completely take over a running Linux system remotely, allowing you
to log into an in-memory rescue environment, unmount the original root
filesystem, and do anything you want, all without rebooting. Replace one distro
with another without touching a physical console.
